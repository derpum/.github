# Hi, I'm der Pum ðŸ‘‹

I'm a german streamer and developer who loves to play all kind of games and like to translate pokemon rom hacks!

## About Me

I've been a fan of the pokemon franchise since I was a kid, and I've always been fascinated by the different ways people can modify the games.
As I grew older, I became interested in the rom hacking community and started exploring different hacks and mods.

One thing I noticed was that many hacks were only available in english.
As someone who speaks german as their first language, I wanted to change that.
So, I started translating hacks into german so that more people could enjoy them.

## What I Do

On my YouTube and Twitch channel, I stream gameplay and other non rom hacking related stuff mostly in german.

## My Projects

Some of the rom hacks I've translated so far include:

- [Red++ v3](https://github.com/derpum/rpp-v3-german)
- [Black and White 3: Genesis](https://github.com/derpum/BW3G-german)

I'm always on the lookout for new hacks to translate, so if you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know!
